# odin-recipes
Project from Foundations > HTML Foundations

This project involves creating a website that lists multiple recipes.

Skills demonstrated in this project:

- Use of basic HTML tags to create elements like: headers, paragraphs, images, links, unordered lists and ordered lists

- Basic Git and GitHub workflow

Self-reflection after project completion:

So far, the HTML lessons have been more or less review for me since my undergrad included web design, but it's a good refresher since I haven't worked with it in a while.

Learning Git and GitHub for the first time is really exciting! Especially since I've already started using it outside of The Odin Project lessons. I am going to try to adopt it in other areas, if possible.

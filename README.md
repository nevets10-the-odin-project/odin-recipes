# Project: Recipes

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

## Introduction

It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

## Post project review
This project involves creating a website that lists multiple recipes.

Skills demonstrated in this project:

- Use of basic HTML tags to create elements like: headers, paragraphs, images, links, unordered lists and ordered lists

- Basic Git and GitHub workflow

Self-reflection after project completion:

So far, the HTML lessons have been more or less review for me since my undergrad included web design, but it's a good refresher since I haven't worked with it in a while.

Learning Git and GitHub for the first time is really exciting! Especially since I've already started using it outside of The Odin Project lessons. I am going to try to adopt it in other areas, if possible.
